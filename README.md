# Notable Health Backend Interview

Technologies used:

- Node.js

- Typescript

- Express.js

- Typeorm + SQLite3

#### Running the project

- install deps with `npm install`

- run the project with `npm run dev`

#### Sample HTTP requests

I've included a recommended extension to help test the project, [VS Code Rest Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)

If you prefer you can use your own client like postman or insomnia.

If you check the `./requests.rest` file I've included some sample requests that you can make to the API.
